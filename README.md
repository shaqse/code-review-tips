Nitpicks in code reviews: annoying or helpful?

Many developers complain about it. But when done right, they are excellent tools to improve quality.

Here are 5 tips on how to nitpick:

• Prefix your comment with "Nit:"
• Use it for namings, typos and minor suggestions
• Suggest, never command
• Provide specific examples
• Approve the PR if you have only nitpicks

Examples:

❌ Change that function name, it's bad

✅ Nit: I would recommend to rename that function to express business knowledge, for example: findAvailableFlights
